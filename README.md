**Description of the data set**

_Reference data set source from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/_

This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality , I just shared it to kaggle for convenience. (If I am mistaken and the public license type disallowed me from doing so, I will take this down if requested.)
